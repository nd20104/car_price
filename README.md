# car price prediction with linear regression 

### Dateset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aminesnoussi/carprice-assignmentcsv

### I've uploaded a dataset file and python model code to these repositories.

### In this study, I used the kaggle dataset to develop a classification model. The accuracy scope and linear regression approach were used in the prediction section. I used the sklearn model to predict the x train test and the y train test model that was released.

### the three most important python libraries I'm using numpy, pandas, and seaborn, and for the visual plot, I'm using the matplotlib package.
